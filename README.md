# Online Boggle Startup (CS 260)
## 30 Second Pitch:
```
This startup application is a solution to the extremely common problem with the board game Boggle, where 
all players have to be in person. In this application, Boggle will be accessible to users across the 
world, all in real time based on the round they are in.
```
## Key Features:
- Online real-time with timer
- Everyone has the same board
- User login
- Voting screen (post-round to determine points)
- Stats Board
- 2 to 6 players

### Ethan's Notes:

ssh -i ~/.ssh/cs260.pem ubuntu@3.131.64.245

- SVG's are kind of a pain to work with, but I found out how to make them in illustrator (as I normally do) and export them as code
- The buttons for SIMON were suprisingly a lot, svg within a button within a cell, within a table, within a div
- I really wanted the pages to have a common header/footer that I could just have separately and import so I wouldn't have to do so much
copying and pasting. Needless to say, that was a rabbit hole I never really figured out, maybe someday as I get better at this web programming stuff
```
### Blake's Notes:
```
IP Address: 3.132.220.196
ssh -i (key) ubuntu@3.132.220.196

- I am currently having trouble routing my domain to my website, I will ask about this during class on 2/1.
