# startup
startup repository for CS 260

this was changed in VS Code

and this line was added in GitHub

and this new one in GitHub

and this new one in GitHub

and this is the corresponding VS code line

And now for some actual notes...this was weird, mostly because I was switching back and forth beteen the command line and the source control in VS code. 
There's also different options in the VS code for committing, there was commit, commit and sync, and commit and push.
After going through the activity, I think I can see where all of them come into play.
It was also hard to push for the first time because I had a username and password, but my password didn't work, so I used the token instead (maybe that's how
it's supposed to be, but it should say token instead of password in my opinion). And then I have to copy and paste the token every single time I push, which is kind of annyoying
But if I use the commit and push button instead of using the command line, then I don't need the token every single time...so I think I'll just go with that from now on.
