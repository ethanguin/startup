# Online Boggle Startup (CS 260)
## 30 Second Pitch:
```
This startup application is a solution to the extremely common problem with the board game Boggle, where 
all players have to be in person. In this application, Boggle will be accessible to users across the 
world, all in real time based on the round they are in.
```
## Key Features:
- Online real-time with timer
- Everyone has the same board
- User login
- Voting screen (post-round to determine points)
- Stats Board
- 2 to 6 players
